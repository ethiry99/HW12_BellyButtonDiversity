# HW12_BellyButtonDiversity

## Purpose 

#### Three charts have been created to allow for review of the belly button bacteria data.  They are all controlled with the drop down menu on the left side of the page.  It defauts to Subject ID 940 when the page is loaded or refreshed.
1. Bar Chart- Shows bars for the top 10 most numerous bacteria.  When a bar is hovered over a pop up show the number of bacteria observed, the OTU ID for that bacteria, and the scientific name of the bacteria.

2. Bubble Chart- The bubbles are arranged horizontally, along the x axis, from smallest to largest OTU ID.  They are arranged vertically by the number of bacteria observed.  The size of the bubbles is also dependant on the the number of bacteria present.  On hovering the pop up displays the OTU ID, number of bacteria, and the scientific name.

3. Gauge Chart- The gauge chart displays the number of scrubbings per week of the test subject's belly button.  The number is displayed in a large numeral as well as by the guage indicator.

## Customizations

 1. A picture was added to the Jumbotron and the text color was change to white for improved readability.

 2. The background of the body of the page was changed to light blue.  It coordinates with the Jumbotron picture.

 3. Vertical spaces were added between the charts to improve the appearance.

 4. The layout was changed to separate the barchart from the demographic info and the guage chart.  It allows each to be displayed without crowding.

 5. After removing the bar chart from the top row the guage chart was displaying very close to the demographic info.  I added code to center it within its own Bootstrap column.
